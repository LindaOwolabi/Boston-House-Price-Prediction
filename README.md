# Boston-House-Price-Prediction
Third task submission at the Sync Intern's

Boston house price prediction: The goal of this project is to create a regression model that is able to accurately estimate the price of a house given the features.

Housing prices are an important reflection of the economy, and house price ranges are of great interest for both buyers and sellers. In this project, house prices will be predicted given explanatory variables that cover many aspects of residential houses.
